HappyUpnp
=========

Happy Upnp will gladly do the following for you:

* Generate UPnP Control Point Proxy types.

[@bentayloruk](http://twitter.com/bentayloruk) built Happy Upnp in order to generate control point types for his Sonos machines.  Of course, he should have used one of the many existing UPnP libraries.  However, they don't all work on Xamarin iOS and many seem abandoned or hard to get doing with.

## Things you should know

Happy Upnp wont make you happy in all UPnP scanrios.

* UPnP 1.1 only.
* No IPv6 support.
